            <p>Dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that lived millions of years ago during the Mesozoic Era, which lasted from about 250 to 66 million years ago. They came in many shapes and sizes—some were small like chickens, while others, like the Tyrannosaurus rex and Brachiosaurus, were enormous. Some dinosaurs walked on two legs, others on four, and they had different diets; some were carnivores that ate meat, while others were herbivores that fed on plants.

Dinosaurs became extinct around 66 million years ago due to a sudden event called the Cretaceous Paleogene extinction. Scientists believe the main cause of their extinction was a giant asteroid that struck Earth near what is now Mexico. The impact caused massive fires, dust clouds, and blocked sunlight, which led to a drastic change in the climate. These environmental changes made it difficult for dinosaurs and many other species to survive. In addition to the asteroid, volcanic eruptions and long-term climate changes may have also played a role in their extinction.

However, not all dinosaurs completely disappeared. Scientists believe that birds are the modern descendants of certain small, feathered dinosaurs. In this way, dinosaurs still exist today—just in a different form.

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p> Extinct animals are species that no longer exist anywhere on Earth. This means that there are no living members of that species left. Extinction can happen for many reasons, including natural events like volcanic eruptions, climate changes, or diseases. However, many animals have become extinct because of human activities, such as hunting, pollution, destruction of habitats, and introduction of invasive species. Examples of extinct animals include the dodo, passenger pigeon, Tasmanian tiger, and many species of dinosaurs. Studying extinct animals helps scientists understand the past and find ways to protect endangered species today.
